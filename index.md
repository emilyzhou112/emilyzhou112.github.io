# Emily's Open Source GIS Portfolio

Hi! My name is Emily and welcome to my Open Source GIS portfolio. I am a junior majoring Geography and double minoring in Japanese Studies & Computer Science at Middlebury College.

This website is a documentation of GIS analyses, course reflections, and other cartographic works that I have done for [GEOG 0323: Open Source GIScience](http://gis4dev.github.io) in Fall 2021 with Professor Jospeh Holler as well as other relevant project works from geography classes at Middlebury.

> It might be boring to count how many islands are above on the *Thousand Island Lake*
