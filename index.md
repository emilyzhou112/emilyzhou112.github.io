# Emily's World of Geography

Hi! My name is Emily and welcome to my geography portfolio. I am a junior majoring Geography and double minoring in Japanese Studies & Computer Science at Middlebury College.

This website is a documentation of GIS analyses, course reflections, cartographic works, and other relevant geography projetcs that I have done at Middlebury for (ordered chronologically):

- [GEOG 0202: Border Geographies](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0202) in Fall 2020 with professor Guntram Herb.
- [GEOG 0120: Human Geography with GIS](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0120) in Fall 2020 with professor Joseph Holler.
- [GEOG 1026: Visualizing Our Future](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG1026) in Winter 2021 with visiting instructor Ben Meader.
