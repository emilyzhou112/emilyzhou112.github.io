# Welcome To My World of GIS, Planning, and Design! 

## [GIS for Planning and Policy](pages/gis_planning.md)

This section of the portfolio highlights projects that use geospatial analysis and modeling to address urban planning, public health, and environmental challenges. Key projects include optimizing EVSE site selection, predicting home prices, analyzing transit-oriented development, and modeling crime and opioid overdose risks. 

## [Open Source GIScience Analysis](pages/open_gis.md)

This section of the portfolio features project that apply advanced spatial statistics and focus on reproducibility in health and hazards geography. Using open-source tools like R, Python, and PostgreSQL, these projects cover topics such as respiratory disease prediction with remote sensing, COVID-19 healthcare access, water vulnerability in Tanzania, and social media analysis for disaster response, all emphasizing transparent and replicable research.

## [Cartographic and Urban Design](pages/cart_design.md)

This section of the portfolio highlights a series of cartographic and urban design projects that explore historical and contemporary landscapes through innovative visualizations. The works include detailed reproductions of historic Philadelphia street scenes, architectural studies of iconic buildings in Burlington, and mapping exercises focusing on accessibility, conservation, and sustainable development. Each project emphasizes design elements such as texture, typography, and color theory, offering a balance between aesthetic appeal and spatial analysis. 

## [Big Data Visualization](pages/data_viz.md)

This section showcases projects focused on visualizing and analyzing large datasets, using interactive dashboards and generative art. Highlights include an interactive COVID-19 dashboard that tracks national and state-level trends using D3.js, a generative art sketchbook explores creative coding, and the EarthQuaker Dashboard visualizes global seismic activities using real-time data. 


## [Reflections on Geospatial Research](pages/blogs.md)

This section delves into key reflections on the evolving landscape of geospatial research. The discussions cover the transformative role of open-source GIScience, the debates around whether GIS is a tool or a science highlight its dual role in advancing spatial theory and inquiry, the importance of reproducibility, uncertainty, as well as the ethical considerations in geographic research, particularly within contexts like vulnerability modeling and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) during crises.

## About Me
I am a human geographer and urban planner with a strong foundation in geographic information science, cartography, and comprehensive planning. My research experience centers on designing and developing geospatial research methods, with a particular focus on uncertainty analyses, spatial decision support systems, and spatial optimizations. I am deeply interested in refining geospatial research design and validating existing methodologies to address complex planning challenges that lies at the intersection of public health, climate change, and social justice, etc. 

I earned my Bachelor's of Art degree in Geography with double minors in Computer Science and Japanese Studies from [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/geography), where I had focused on learning open-source, geospatial analytical tools and their applications in health and hazard geography problems.  After graduating, I enrolled in the Master's of City Planning program at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning). While at Penn, I've worked as a research scientist for the [Communication Neroscience Lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab/research/geoscan-smoking-study) at the Annenberg School of Communications through the PennPraxis Design Fellowship. My daily tasks include supporting neuroscience researchers to refine their research on the impact of point-of-sale tobacco marketing on neural activity and travel behavior, and optimizing R packages for analyzing human mobility patterns. Meanwhile, I am also a research assistant at the Lassiter Lab at the Weitzman School of Design, where I develop and parameterize a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model for infrastructure selection in water supply systems at Tampa Bay, FL to help local planners understand the complexity of water management challenges under climate change.
