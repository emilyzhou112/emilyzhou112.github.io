> Solving Geography problems helps you to solve life problem! [See](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P159870) how leading geographic information technology and effective spatial planning in Chun'an have ensured drinking water supply for millions of people in China.

## Open Source GIScience Analyses
I have expanded my experience in geospatial analysis through learning advanced spatial statistics and reproducing studies using open source geospatial software. In Fall 2021, I reproduced three health and hazards spatial analysis studies using open source R or Python code and completed a reproducible study on urban resource accessibility using Postgre SQL.
- [Water Amenity Access and Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](dsm_analysis/dsm_report.md)
- [Reproduction of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources Spatial Accessibility in Chicago, Illinois](RPr-Kang/re-analysis.md)
- [Replication of Twitter Data Analysis for Natural Hazards](RE-Ida/ida.md)

## New England Planning with Mock Mapping Charrettes
In winter 2021, I worked with Middlebury alumni [Ben Meader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-meader-5ba6923a), current director of Rhumb Line Maps to practice solving real planning issues in New England. I created a series of maps and visual studies on public transport access, habitat conservation, and residential development, etc. and presented in 4 mock stakeholder meetings.
