# Welcome To My World of GIS, Planning, and Design! 


My current academic and research work mainly focus on using GIS, geospatial machine learning, and cartographic design to study urban resource accessibility, community health and vulnerability, as well as smart cities technology implementation.

## [GIS for Planning and Policy](pages/gis_planning.md)

Geospatial machine learning work in planning and public policy realm. Mostly aimed towards developing models to efficiently allocate limited resources across space. Use cases for these models include transportation planning, housing, public health, criminal justice, and beyond. Also include the research paper on GIS based MCDA. 

## [Open Source GIScience Analysis](pages/open_gis.md)

Advanced spatial statistics, reproducibility and replicability work in health and hazards geography using open source R or Python code and Postgre SQL. 


## [Cartographic and Urban Design](pages/cart_design.md)

Created a series of maps and visual studies on public transport access, habitat conservation, and residential development, etc. and presented in 4 mock stakeholder meetings. Architecture and cartography studies at Midd and Penn.
