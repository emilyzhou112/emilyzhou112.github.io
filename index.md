# Welcome to My World of GIS, Planning, and Design

I am a 
applied them to faciliate planning and decision-making 

My current academic and research work mainly focus on using GIS, geospatial machine learning, and cartographic design to study urban resource accessibility, community health and vulnerability, as well as smart cities technology implementation.

## [GIS for Planning and Policy](pages/gis_planning.md)

Geospatial machine learning work in planning and public policy realm. Mostly aimed towards developing models to efficiently allocate limited resources across space. Use cases for these models include transportation planning, housing, public health, criminal justice, and beyond. Also include the research paper on GIS based MCDA. 

## [Open Source GIScience Analysis](pages/open_gis.md)

Advanced spatial statistics, reproducibility and replicability work in health and hazards geography using open source R or Python code and Postgre SQL.

## New England Planning with Mock Mapping Charrettes

In Winter 2021, I worked with Middlebury alumni [Ben Meader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-meader-5ba6923a), current director of Rhumb Line Maps to practice solving real planning issues in New England. I created a series of maps and visual studies on public transport access, habitat conservation, and residential development, etc. and presented in 4 mock stakeholder meetings.

## Cartography and Architectural Studies

I honed my skills in design through studying architecture with Middlebury alumni [Alix Pauchet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alix-pauchet-b0591367) in Winter 2021 and cartography with Professor [Jeff Howarth](https://jeffhowarth.github.io/) in Spring 2021.

## Data Visualization Projects

I also applied my interest and expertise in spatial data analysis and visualization to various project works in Geography, Computer Science, and Math that cover topics ranging from public health, geopolitics, generative art, and more!
