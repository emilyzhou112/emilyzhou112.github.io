*Qiandao Lake, Chun'an, China*

> Solving Geography problems helps you to solve life problem! [See](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P159870) how leading geographic information technology and effective spatial planning in Chun'an have ensured drinking water supply for millions of people in China.

## Open Source GIScience Analyses
I have expanded my experience in geospatial analysis through learning advanced spatial statistics and reproducing studies using open source geospatial software. In Fall 2021, I reproduced three health and hazards spatial analysis studies using open source R or Python code and completed a reproducible study on urban resource accessibility using Postgre SQL.

- [Water Amenity Access and Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](dsm_analysis/dsm_report.md)
- [Reproduction of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources Spatial Accessibility in Chicago, Illinois](RPr-Kang/re-analysis.md)
- [Replication of Twitter Data Analysis for Natural Hazards](RE-Ida/ida.md)
- [Reproduction and Replication Analysis of Academic Information Patterns under COVID-19](covidpattern/report.md)

## New England Planning with Mock Mapping Charrettes
In winter 2021, I worked with Middlebury alumni [Ben Meader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-meader-5ba6923a), current director of Rhumb Line Maps to practice solving real planning issues in New England. I created a series of maps and visual studies on public transport access, habitat conservation, and residential development, etc. and presented in 4 mock stakeholder meetings.

- [Law and Social Justice in Boston, Massachusetts](1026reports/week4.md)
- [Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Southern Vermont](120reports/exam2.md)

## Cartography and Architectural Studies
I honed my skills in design through studying architecture with Middlebury alumni [Alix Pauchet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alix-pauchet-b0591367) in Winter 2021 and cartography with Professor [Jeff Howarth](https://jeffhowarth.github.io/) in Spring 2021. One of the maps I made, A Journey of Cherry Blossom Through Time, was selected for presentation in the 42nd Annual Meeting of North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

## Data Visualization Projects
I also applied my interest and expertise in spatial data analysis and visualization to various project works in Geography, Computer Science, and Math that cover topics ranging from public health, geopolitics, migration, and more!

- [The Sino-Myanmar Border Conflict](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/672602e5a37b4643a121110efa7d855a)

## GIS Research on Reproducibility and Replicability in Geographical Science
In summer 2022, I worked as a GIS research assistant Middlebury College professor [Joseph Holler](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/people/joseph-holler) as well as Professor [Peter Kedron](https://search.asu.edu/profile/3316903) and graduate students from Arizona State University to reproduce spatial health geography papers. We drafted computational notebooks and completed three research compendiums as GitHub repositories. We also organized [workshops](https://www.ucgis.org/workshops-2022#HEGS) at the 2022 University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) Symposium in Syracuse, New York, to help graduate students to make their research reproducible and inform public health officials on decision making.

[presentations](https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2023/solicitations/39/sessiongallery/5681/application/23932) at the 2023 American Association of Geographer (AAG) Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado are available [here](https://github.com/HEGSRR/AAG-2023).

## Remote Sensing Research on Congo Basin Forest Change
Since Spring 2022, I have worked with Middlebury College Professor Niwaeli Kimambo and Phd candidate Sarah Tolbert at University of Wisconsin Madison on managing spatial database that record study sites and metadata of included journals in comparing the drivers of deforestation versus degradation.

This is an ongoing work. Final results will be shared soon, but for now you can view the project layers [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Omn3vSY2g0Sdce00yJmtXgxZcyknD6v?usp=sharing).
