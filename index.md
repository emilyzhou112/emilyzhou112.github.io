# Emily's World of Geography

Hi! My name is Emily and welcome to my geography portfolio. I am a senior majoring in Geography and double minoring in Japanese Studies & Computer Science at Middlebury College.

This website is a documentation of GIS analyses, course reflections, cartographic works, and other relevant geography projects that I have done at Middlebury for:

- [Border Geographies](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0202) with professor Guntram Herb.
- [Human Geography with GIS](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0120) and [Open Source GIScience](http://gis4dev.github.io) with professor Joseph Holler.
- [Visualizing Our Future](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG1026) with visiting instructor Ben Meader.
- [Population Geography](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0213) with professor Peter Nelson.
- [Buildings of the City](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMIISLPP/term/term%2F202210/course/course%2FINTD1240) with visiting instructors Zane Anthony and Alix Pauchet.
