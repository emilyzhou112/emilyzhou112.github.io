# Emily's World of Geography

Hi! My name is Emily and welcome to my geography portfolio. I am a junior majoring Geography and double minoring in Japanese Studies & Computer Science at Middlebury College.

This website is a documentation of GIS analyses, course reflections, cartographic works, and other relevant projetcs that I have done at Middlebury for (order chronologically):

- [GEOG 1026: Visualizing Our Future](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG1026) in Winter 2021 with visiting instructor Ben Meader.
- [GEOG 0323: Open Source GIScience](http://gis4dev.github.io) in Fall 2021 with professor Jospeh Holler.  
- [INTD 1240: Buildings of the City](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMIISLPP/term/term%2F202210/course/course%2FINTD1240) in Winter 2022 with visiting instructors Zane Anthony and Alix Pauchet.

> It might be boring to count how many islands are above on the *Thousand Island Lake*
> but never dull to learn how techniques used in GIS researches and effective spatial planning have played a significant role in ensuring drinking water supply for millions of people.
