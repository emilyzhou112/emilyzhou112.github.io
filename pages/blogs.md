## [What is Open Source GIScience?](../blogposts/open-giscience.md)

> The concept of open-source GIScience represents a transformative shift in spatial analysis. Drawing inspiration from Eric S. Raymond's analogy of cathedrals and bazaars in software development, open-source GIS fosters a collaborative research environment, where students and researchers can freely access, modify, and improve geospatial tools. This empowers researchers to tailor software to their specific needs, breaking away from the limitations of proprietary systems. While challenges such as code complexity and rapid software changes remain, the growing role of open-source GIS continues to drive innovation and enhance scientific reproducibility.

## [GIS: Science or Tool?](../blogposts/science_tool.md)

> As Geographic Information Systems (GIS) become increasingly sophisticated, they are not only tools for spatial analysis but also vehicles for advancing spatial theory and inquiry. This evolution has sparked a debate: is GIS merely a practical tool, or is it an emerging science in its own right? The answer lies in the continuum between these two perspectives, where GIS may serve as both a powerful analytical tool and a discipline that develops theories, algorithms, and methodologies essential for scientific discovery.

## [Reproducibility and Replicability in Geography](../blogposts/r_r.md)

> As scientific research expands, the importance of reproducibility and replicability (R&R) grows. These practices are vital for ensuring the credibility and advancement of research, allowing findings to be verified and built upon. This blog post explores R&R's role in academia, focusing on Kedron and Sui's article on geography. Reproducing and replicating studies help validate results and foster collaboration, but challenges persist, especially in fields like geography with its complex spatial and temporal contexts. This reflection highlights R&R's benefits and limitations, emphasizing the need to understand and learn from both successful and non-reproducible results.

## [Error and Uncertainty in GIS](../blogposts/error_uncertainty.md)

> In geographic research, the sophistication of tools and methods can create a false sense of accuracy. This blog post explores the inherent uncertainties in spatial analysis, using a flood hazard study in southern Vermont as a case in point. It highlights how discrepancies in data and methods reveal the complexities of geographic research. By examining uncertainty in conception, measurement, and analysis, we emphasize the importance of acknowledging and addressing these uncertainties to improve the reliability and impact of geographic studies.

## [Learning Spatial Analysis in CyberGIS Environment](../blogposts/cybergis.md)

> Exploring spatial analytical research through CyberGIS versus traditional desktop GIS reveals significant differences in scope and capability. CyberGIS, akin to large-scale infrastructure, supports complex, data-intensive research and collaboration on a grand scale. In contrast, desktop GIS is more suited to individual, localized analyses. This blog post contrasts these approaches, highlighting how CyberGIS advances spatial analysis by integrating advanced computational tools and fostering reproducibility and collaboration, as demonstrated in Kang et al.’s study on medical resource accessibility during Covid-19. While traditional GIS remains valuable for foundational learning, CyberGIS opens new horizons for tackling intricate, interdisciplinary geospatial problems.

## [Uncertainty Analysis in Vulnerability Research](../blogposts/vulnerability.md)

> Understanding and managing uncertainty is crucial in spatial research, particularly in vulnerability modeling. This blog post examines how uncertainty manifests at various stages of research, drawing on Longley et al.'s framework and Tate's analysis of vulnerability index construction. We explore the complexities and challenges involved in translating real-world phenomena into data, using Malcomb et al.'s study in Malawi as a case study. By dissecting the stages of conception, measurement, representation, and analysis, we highlight how decisions at each phase introduce uncertainty, influencing the reliability and validity of vulnerability assessments. This discussion underscores the importance of critically evaluating and addressing uncertainty to enhance the robustness of spatial analyses.

## [Applications, Limitations, and Ethical Issues in VGI](../blogposts/vgi.md)

> Social media has revolutionized how we collect and analyze data on human behavior, particularly during crises. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram provide real-time insights into people’s experiences and responses during disasters. However, this data also presents significant challenges, including issues with data representativeness, platform algorithms, and ethical concerns around privacy and consent. This discussion explores these limitations using Hurricane Dorian as a case study, aiming to highlight both the potential and the pitfalls of using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in crisis research.

## [Social Inequities under Public Health Crisis](../blogposts/covid_disability.md)

> This semester's exploration into social inequities in healthcare and disaster response has highlighted critical issues in resource distribution and representation. Building on Kang's analysis of medical resources and the underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in social media data, our final study extends these insights by examining COVID-19's impact on people with disabilities (PwD). By replicating Chakraborty's research on the relationship between disability and COVID-19 incidence, we aim to enhance understanding of how systemic inequities manifest across different dimensions of public health and disability.
