### [Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Southern Vermont](../cart/120reports/exam2.md)

This project assesses the vulnerability of mobile homes to flood risk in four Vermont counties using three different approaches. It compares FEMA flood zones and Vermont River Program data to understand how flood risks, including fluvial erosion, are represented. The analysis highlights the uncertainty in flood risk assessments and aims to improve understanding of natural hazard management in the context of housing vulnerability.
