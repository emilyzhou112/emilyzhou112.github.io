## [Water Amenity Access and Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](../dsm_analysis/dsm_report.md)

This project uses GIS to assess how flooding impacts water accessibility in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. By analyzing spatial data on wards, water sources, flood extent, and residential buildings, the study identifies households whose access to water is compromised during floods. Using QGIS and PostgreSQL with PostGIS, the project maps service areas for water amenities and visualizes the spatial patterns of water insecurity at the ward level. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of water access issues on vulnerable populations in informal settlements, supporting efforts to improve resource allocation and resilience planning in the city.
