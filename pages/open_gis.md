## [Spatial Estimation of Chronic Respiratory Disease With Geospatial Machine Learning - An Approach Using Earth-Engine-Based Remote Sensing Data and Air Quality Variables in the State of Pennsylvania](../musa-reports/PA-CRD-2024.html)

This project applies machine learning and remote sensing data to predict Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD) hospitalizations in Pennsylvania, expanding on previous work by Alvarez-Mendoza et al. By integrating satellite imagery, air quality, and meteorological data across 5000x5000m grid cells, the analysis compares support vector regression, random forest regression, and multilayer perceptron models to identify key environmental predictors of CRD risk. The study improves on the original by incorporating spatial interpolation of air quality data, dividing Pennsylvania into uniform grid cells, and accounting for seasonal variations. The workflow emphasizes reproducibility with structured data processing and cross-validation techniques.

## [Water Amenity Access and Flood Hazard Vulnerability in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](../dsm_analysis/dsm_report.md)

This project uses GIS to assess how flooding impacts water accessibility in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. By analyzing spatial data on wards, water sources, flood extent, and residential buildings, the study identifies households whose access to water is compromised during floods. Using QGIS and PostgreSQL with PostGIS, the project maps service areas for water amenities and visualizes the spatial patterns of water insecurity at the ward level. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of water access issues on vulnerable populations in informal settlements, supporting efforts to improve resource allocation and resilience planning in the city.
