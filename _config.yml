title: Emily Zhou's Portfolio
description: Hi there! My name is Emily and I am a senior student at Middlebury College majoring in Geography and double minoring in Computer Science and Japanese Studies. I am passionate about using geographic information system (GIS), spatial data analysis, and cartographic design to expand on studies that intersect social vulnerability, climate change adaptation, public transportation, environmental sustainability, and urban resource accessibility. This page is a documentation of GIS analyses, course reflections, cartographic works, and other relevant projects that I have done at Middlebury.
