title: GIS along the Tool-Science Continuum
---

As GIS continues to play a prominent role in spatial analysis, it also starts to engage with the more fundamental aspects of modeling spatial phenomena, asking and answering thought-provoking questions, and being applied to other disciplines. This growing complexity and sophistication associated with GIS leads to the debate of whether it still remains a tool for research use or becomes a science that itself entails ideas, theories, hypothesis, etc.

Before picking a side in the tool-science debate, it is essential to first outline the justifications of why GIS qualify as a tool/science.

### What is science?

### The tool science dichotomy

### The tool science continuum: tool, tool-making, science

### Implications of "Doing GIS"
